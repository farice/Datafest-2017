# Datafest-2017

This project was created during DataFest 2017 from March 31st-April 2nd at Duke University. Our team was a finalist in the competition.

We considered the implications of linguistic simplicity in American Expedia user's propensity to book hotel rooms in foreign destinations. The tools we used to achieve this goal and visualize the result are:

1. Principal Component Analysis
2. Random Forest Classifier
3. Directed network/graph

The statistical analysis can be viewed in analysis.Rmd and our presentation with associated documentation in ChapelBoysR-Presentation.pptx and ChapelBoysR-Writeup.docx, respectively.
