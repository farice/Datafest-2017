• Data.gov (http://www.data.gov/) has a huge compilation of data sets produced by the US
government.
• The Supreme Court Database (http://scdb.wustl.edu/data.php) tracks all cases decided by the US
Supreme Court.
• US government spending data (http://usaspending.gov/data) has information about government
contracts and awards.
• Federal Election Commission (http://www.fec.gov/disclosure.shtml) has campaign finance data to
download; their “disclosure portal” (http://www.fec.gov/pindex.shtml) also provide nice interfaces
for exploring the data.

• GovTrack.us (http://www.govtrack.us/developers) tracks all bills through the Congress and all votes
casted by its members. The Washington Post has a nice website
(http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/113/) for exploring this type of data (in predefined
ways), but you can be creative with additional and/or more flexible exploration and analysis options.
• Each state legislature maintains its own voting records. For example, you can find North Carolina’s
here: http://www.ncleg.net/Legislation/voteHistory/voteHistory.html. Some states provide records
in already structured formats, but for others, you may need to scrape their websites.
• The Washington Post maintains a list of datasets (http://www.washingtonpost.com/wpsrv/metro/data/datapost.html)
that have been used to generate investigative news pieces. Most of
these datasets hide behind some interface and may need to be scraped. Use this list for examples of
what datasets are “interesting” and how to present data to the public effectively.
• Stanford Journalism Program maintains a list of curated transportation-related datasets
(http://www.datadrivenstanford.org/).
• National Institute for Computer-Assisted Reporting maintains a list of datasets of public interest
(http://www.ire.org/nicar/database-library/). Use this list for examples of what datasets are
“interesting”—they are generally not available to the public, but there may be alternative ways to
obtain them.
• Google Fusion Table (http://www.google.com/fusiontables/Home/) hosts quite a number of
datasets of public interest. It is a good place to find datasets or data sources to work on, and you can
consider using it as a method of hosting your data for public access
