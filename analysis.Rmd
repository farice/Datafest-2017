## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r, results="hide"}
load(file="dest_sub.RData")
apply(dest_sub ,2,mean)
apply(dest_sub, 2, var)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
pca.out=prcomp(dest_sub, scale=TRUE)
#pca.out
names(pca.out)
biplot(pca.out, scale=0)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
